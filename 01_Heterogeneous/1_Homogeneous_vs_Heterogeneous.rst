Heterogeneous vs Homogeneous Computing Environments
#####################################################

Homogeneous Compute
======================

Homogeneous computing refers to a system where all processing units are of the same type and have similar capabilities. In this setup, multiple identical processors work together to execute tasks in parallel. On the other hand, heterogeneous computing involves a system that combines different types of processing units, such as CPUs (Central Processing Units), GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays), or specialized accelerators. Each processing unit is designed to perform specific tasks efficiently.

One may choose homogeneous computing when the workload is well-suited for parallel execution on multiple identical processors. It simplifies programming as the same code can be executed on all processors, and load balancing among processors is relatively straightforward. Homogeneous computing is often employed in high-performance computing (HPC) clusters and distributed systems that require large-scale parallel processing.

Heterogeneous Compute
=======================

Heterogeneous computing is preferred when the workload consists of tasks that can benefit from different types of processing units. For example, GPUs excel at parallelizing graphics and general-purpose computing tasks, while FPGAs offer highly customizable and efficient processing for specific algorithms. By utilizing specialized accelerators, heterogeneous computing systems can achieve higher performance and energy efficiency for certain workloads.

Advantages of accelerators in heterogeneous computing include
=================================================================

1. Enhanced performance: Accelerators are specifically designed to excel at certain types of computations. By offloading specific tasks to accelerators, overall performance can be significantly improved.

2. Energy efficiency: Accelerators are often optimized for a particular type of algorithm, allowing for better performance per watt compared to general-purpose processors.

3. Ability to further optimize ones code: With accelerators, developers can tailor the hardware and software for specific algorithms or applications, enabling higher performance and efficiency.

Challenges using accelerators in a heterogeneous computing environment
=========================================================================

1. Programming complexity: Unlike homogeneous systems, heterogeneous computing requires different programming models and languages for various processing units. This complexity increases the development effort.

2. Data movement: Efficiently moving data between different processing units can be a bottleneck. Developers must carefully manage data transfers between accelerators and the main CPU in order to minimize overhead.

3. Load balancing: In a heterogeneous system, workload distribution and load balancing become more complex due to the diverse capabilities of different processing units. Proper load balancing is essential to fully utilize the system's resources.

Software Development Techniques
=================================

The software development techniques for homogeneous and heterogeneous computing have typically required different approaches in the past.

In homogeneous computing, the programming model was typically based on parallel processing paradigms such as message passing (MPI) or shared memory (OpenMP). Developers focused on parallelizing code across multiple identical processors and optimizing data dependencies and synchronization.

Heterogeneous computing typically used different programming models and APIs for each type of accelerator and CPU. For example, CUDA and ROCm are commonly used for programming vendor specific GPUs requiring developers to have a unique tool chain for each development target.  In addition developers would need to become familiar with how to design and optimize algorithms for each type of accelerator and how best to partition the workload and manage data movement between different host and devices.  

Summary
========

In summary, homogeneous computing utilizes identical processors for parallel processing, while heterogeneous computing combines different processing units to achieve performance and efficiency gains for specific tasks. The choice between them depends on the nature of the workload. Accelerators in heterogeneous computing offer advantages in performance and efficiency but introduce challenges related to programming complexity, data movement, and load balancing. Software development techniques also differ, with homogeneous computing focusing on parallelization across identical processors and heterogeneous computing requiring different programming models for each processing unit.

In order to address the challenges of having to manage multiple tool-chains and multiple development environment Intel has developed oneAPI.  oneAPI is a project to deliver a unified software development environment across CPU and accelerator architectures.
