SYCL overall benefits
=====================

Usage of SYCL offers a high-level, performance-portable, 
and productive programming model for heterogeneous parallel computing, 
enabling developers to harness the power of modern hardware architectures 
and achieve efficient execution across diverse devices.

Overall, these are some of the SYCL crucial advantages:

- **Heterogeneous Parallelism**: SYCL enables developers to write code that can be executed on heterogeneous platforms, such as CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. It provides a high-level abstraction that allows for easy expression of parallelism across different devices without having to write device-specific code.

- **Single-Source Programming**: With SYCL, you can write a single-source C++ code that targets multiple devices. This eliminates the need to maintain separate codebases for different devices and simplifies code development, debugging, and maintenance.

- **Performance Portability**: SYCL provides a performance-portable programming model. The code you write in SYCL can be compiled and optimized for different devices, taking advantage of their specific architectural features and capabilities. This enables you to achieve high-performance execution on a variety of hardware platforms without significant code modifications.

- **Memory Management Abstraction**: SYCL abstracts away the complexities of memory management in heterogeneous systems. It provides constructs like buffers and accessors that handle data transfers between the host and the device transparently, simplifying memory allocation, data movement, and synchronization.

- **Integration with Existing Codebases**: SYCL can be integrated into existing C++ codebases seamlessly. You can gradually introduce SYCL features into your codebase to accelerate performance-critical sections or specific algorithms, leveraging the benefits of parallelism without requiring a complete rewrite.

- **Ecosystem and Tool Support**: SYCL benefits from a growing ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools. There are numerous libraries and frameworks, such as Eigen, TensorFlow, and oneAPI DPC++ Libraries, that provide SYCL interfaces, allowing you to take advantage of their functionality while utilizing SYCL's parallelism. Additionally, development tools like Intel oneAPI Toolkits and ComputeCpp offer debugging, profiling, and optimization capabilities for SYCL-based applications.

The benefits of using SYCL are multiple and diverse, but in order to take 
advantage of the full SYCL capabilites, it is fist necessary to cover some of 
the most powerful C++ features. This is addressed in the following section:
