SYCL-USM: vector_add
====================

In this section we explore vector addition using USM within the SYCL 
framework. USM enables memory regions that are accessible from 
both the host and the devices, reducing the need for explicit 
data transfers and simplifying memory management. This approach 
not only streamlines code but also allows developers to focus 
on algorithmic design rather than memory-related intricacies. 
The code sample below presents the steps of using USM with SYCL for
vector_add which it offers a more intuitive and efficient 
way to harness the capabilities of heterogeneous computing resources.

Note that with the use of USM there is no need of defining buffers,
handlers and accessors. In this case the malloc_shared function of USM is a sufficient
to allocate and manage memory access:

.. In this discussion, we delve into the world of vector addition 
.. using USM with SYCL. We'll explore the benefits of using USM 
.. for memory management, examine the steps involved in implementing 
.. vector addition with SYCL, and highlight how the SYCL programming 
.. model simplifies the utilization of heterogeneous computing resources. 

.. By the end of this exploration, you'll have a solid understanding 
.. of how to harness the power of USM in SYCL to efficiently perform 
.. vector addition and lay the foundation for more intricate parallel 
.. algorithms.

   int main() {
      queue q;

      //# STEP 1 : Get device information
      std::cout << "Device : " << q.get_device().get_info<info::device::name>() << "\n";

      //# STEP 2 : Initialize vectors in shared memory
      int *data1 = malloc_shared<int>(N, q);
      int *data2 = malloc_shared<int>(N, q);
      int *dataR = malloc_shared<int>(N, q);

      //# STEP 3 : Asign values to vectors
      for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
         data1[i] = 10;
         data2[i] = 20;
         dataR[i] =  0;
      }

      //# STEP 4 : Proceed with the calculation
      q.parallel_for(range<1>(N), [=](id<1> i) {
         dataR[i] = data1[i] + data2[i];
      }).wait();

      //# STEP 5 : Print output values
      for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) std::cout << dataR[i] << " ";
      std::cout << "\n";

      //# STEP 6 : Release memory
      free(data1, q);
      free(data2, q);
      free(dataR, q);

      return 0;
   }

In this example we have used malloc_shared which is appropriate when
data movement happens implicitly between host and device.

Additionally USM offers **malloc_device** and **malloc_host** that
are approches to tackle memory management access by the host or device
explictly but this course does not cover them for now.

So when to use USM versus the conventional SYCL? As a summary, the 
use of USM is a good approach to consider when:

- The code has many pointers that are susceptible to future changes

- When it is expected that the application will gain complexity over time
