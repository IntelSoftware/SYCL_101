Module 2: DPCPP Program Structure
#################################

This module demonstrates basic **SYCL code anatomy** and program structure. You will learn about important **SYCL classes** and different types of kernels. You will also learn about **buffer accessor memory model** and synchronization when using buffers.

Learning Objectives 
********************

* Explain the SYCL fundamental classes.

* Use device selection to offload kernel workloads.

* Decide when to use basic parallel kernels and ND Range kernels.

* Create a host accessor.

* Build a sample SYCL application through hands-on lab exercises.
