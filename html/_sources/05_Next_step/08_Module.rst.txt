Module 8: DPCPP Reduction
#########################

This module demonstrates how reductions can be parallelized. You will learn about the **reduction group algorithm** and **kernel reductions in SYCL**.

Learning Objectives 
********************

* Understand how reductions can be performed with parallel kernels.

* Take advantage of the reduce group function to make reductions at the sub_group and work_group level.

* Use the reduction object to simplify reduction with parallel kernels.

* Use multiple reductions in a single kernel.
