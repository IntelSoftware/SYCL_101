Conclusions
===========

After witnessing the remarkable ease and convenience that SYCL offers through its ``single_task`` and ``parallel_for`` examples, it becomes evident why SYCL is an excellent choice for harnessing the power of heterogeneous computing. **SYCL's user-friendly approach**, as demonstrated by these constructs, **accelerates development, improves code readability, and simplifies parallel programming complexities.** Beyond this, SYCL's inherent cross-platform portability **ensures that your code can effortlessly adapt to diverse hardware architectures**, eliminating the need for extensive platform-specific optimizations.

Remarkably, **SYCL achieves this while preserving performance**, allowing you to tap into the full potential of heterogeneous hardware with ease. Furthermore, SYCL's seamless integration with modern C++ and its robust ecosystem support make it a pragmatic choice for developers seeking to future-proof their applications in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. **In essence, SYCL combines convenience, performance, and versatility, making it an ideal tool for those striving to create efficient and portable code for a wide range of computing platforms.**

The benefits of using SYCL are multiple and diverse. However, before we delve deeper into SYCL's capabilities, it is first necessary to cover some of the most powerful C++ features. This is addressed in the following section: **Modern C++** of this SYCL 101 course.
