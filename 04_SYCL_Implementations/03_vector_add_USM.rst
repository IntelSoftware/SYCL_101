SYCL-USM: vector_add
====================

In this discussion, we present the vector addition case addressed with the use of USM. We'll examine the steps involved in implementing vector addition with SYCL, and highlight how the SYCL programming model simplifies the utilization of heterogeneous computing resources. 

The main takeaway is that with USM there is no requirement to define ``buffers``, ``handlers``, and ``accessors``. In this case, the ``malloc_shared`` function of USM is sufficient to allocate and manage memory access:

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include <CL/sycl.hpp>
   
   using namespace sycl;

   static const int N = 256;

   int main() {
      queue q;

      // STEP 1 : Get device information
      std::cout << "Device : " << q.get_device().get_info<info::device::name>() << "\n";

      // STEP 2 : Initialize vectors in shared memory
      int *data1 = malloc_shared<int>(N, q);
      int *data2 = malloc_shared<int>(N, q);
      int *dataR = malloc_shared<int>(N, q);

      // STEP 3 : Asign values to vectors
      for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
         data1[i] = 10;
         data2[i] = 20;
         dataR[i] =  0;
      }

      // STEP 4 : Proceed with the calculation
      q.parallel_for(range<1>(N), [=](id<1> i) {
         dataR[i] = data1[i] + data2[i];
      }).wait();

      // STEP 5 : Print output values
      for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) std::cout << dataR[i] << " ";
      std::cout << "\n";

      // STEP 6 : Release memory
      free(data1, q);
      free(data2, q);
      free(dataR, q);

      return 0;
   }

This part of the code:

.. code-block:: cpp

      std::cout << "Device : " << q.get_device().get_info<info::device::name>() << "\n";

gets device information from the ``q``, and prints information about the selected device.

and the **USM** gets established here:

.. code-block:: cpp

      int *data1 = malloc_shared<int>(N, q);
      int *data2 = malloc_shared<int>(N, q);
      int *dataR = malloc_shared<int>(N, q);

where three shared memory arrays ``data1``, ``data2``, and ``dataR`` are allocated using ``malloc_shared<int>(N, q)`` and become accessible during computation by both, host and device.

Additionally, USM offers ``malloc_device`` and ``malloc_host``, which are approaches to tackle memory management access by the host or device explicitly, but this course does not cover them for now.

So, when should you use USM versus the conventional SYCL? In summary, using USM is a good approach to consider when:

- The code has many pointers that are susceptible to future changes.

- When it is expected that the application will gain complexity over time.
