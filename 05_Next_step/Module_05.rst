Module 5: Intel Advisor
#######################

This module demonstrates various aspects of **Intel® Advisor**. 
The first uses Intel® Advisor to show performance offload 
opportunities found in a sample application, and then additional 
command-line options for getting offload advisor results. 
The second, gives an example of **roofline analysis** and command 
line options for getting advisor results.

Learning Objectives: 
********************

* To show how Intel® Advisor can help deciding what part of the code should or should not be offloaded on the GPU.

* To run Offload Advisor and generate a HTML report.

* To read and understand the metrics in the report.

* To get a performance estimation of your application on the target hardware.

* To decide which loops are good candidate for offload.
