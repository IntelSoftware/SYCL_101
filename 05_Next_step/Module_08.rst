Module 8: DPCPP Reduction
#########################

This module demonstrates how reductions can be parallelized. You will 
learn about **reduction group alogorithm** and also **kernel reductions in SYCL**.

Learning Objectives: 
********************

* Understand how reductions can be performed with parallel kernels.

* Take advantages reduce group function to do reduction at sub_group and work_group level.

* Use reduction object to simplify reduction with parallel kernels.

* Use multiple reductions in a single kernel.
