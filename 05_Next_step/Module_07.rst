Module 7: DPCPP Library
#######################

This module demonstrates using **IntelÂ® oneAPI DPC++ Library (oneDPL)** for heterogeneous computing. You will learn how to use various Parallel STL algorithms for heterogeneous computing and also look at gamma-correction sample code that uses oneDPL.

Learning Objectives 
********************

* Explain oneDPL Parallel API Algorithms with examples.

* Explain oneDPL Parallel API Iterators with examples.

* Explain oneDPL Extension API Utility classes with examples.
