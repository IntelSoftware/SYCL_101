Module 1: oneAPI Intro
######################

This module introduces you to oneAPI and oneAPI's implementation of SYCL (Data Parallel C++/DPC++). You will learn about the basic SYCL hello world program and how to compile SYCL code for Intel hardware using Data Parallel C++ Compiler.

Learning Objectives 
********************

* Explain how the oneAPI programming model can solve the challenges of programming in a heterogeneous world.

* Use oneAPI projects to enable your workflows.

* Understand the SYCL language and programming model.

* Familiarize yourself with the use Jupyter Notebooks for training throughout the course.
