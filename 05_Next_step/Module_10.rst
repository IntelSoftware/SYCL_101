Module 10: DPCPP Graphs Scheduling Data Management
##################################################

This module demonstrates how to utilize USM and Buffers and accessors 
to apply Memory management and take control over **data movement implicitly 
and explicitly**, utilize different types of data dependences that are 
important for ensuring execution of graph scheduling. You will also learn 
to select the correct modes of **dependences in Graphs scheduling**.
