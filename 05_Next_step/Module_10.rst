Module 10: DPCPP Graphs Scheduling Data Management
##################################################

This module demonstrates how to utilize USM and buffers and accessors[[[USM, buffers, and accessors" or "USM buffers and accessors"?]]] 
to apply memory management and take control over **data movement implicitly 
and explicitly** to help utilize different types of data dependencies that are 
important for ensuring the execution of graph scheduling. You will also learn 
to select the correct modes of **dependencies in graphs scheduling**.
