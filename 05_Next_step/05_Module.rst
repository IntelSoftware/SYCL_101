Module 5: Intel® Advisor
#########################

This module demonstrates various aspects of **Intel® Advisor**. The first uses Intel Advisor to show performance offload opportunities found in a sample application, followed by additional command-line options for getting offload advisor results. The second gives an example of **roofline analysis** and command-line options for getting Advisor results.

Learning Objectives

* Show how Intel Advisor can help you decide which part of the code should or should not be offloaded to the accelerator.

* Run Offload Advisor and generate an HTML report.

* Read and understand the metrics in the report.

* Get a performance estimation of your application on the target hardware.

* Decide which loops are good candidates for accelerator offload.
