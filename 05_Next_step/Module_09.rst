Module 9: DPCPP Buffers And Accessors In Depth
#############################################

This module demonstrates various ways to create **buffers in SYCL**. You will learn how to use **sub-buffers**, buffer properties, and when to use_host_ptr, set_final_data, and set_write_data. You will also learn about accessors, host_accessors, and their use cases.
