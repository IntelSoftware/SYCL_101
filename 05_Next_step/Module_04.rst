Module 4: DPCPP Sub Groups
##########################

This module demonstrates SYCL **Sub-groups** and why they are 
important. The code samples demonstrate how to implement a query 
for sub-group info, sub-group shuffles and sub-group group alogorithms.

Learning Objectives: 
********************

* Understand advantages of using Subgroups in SYCL.

* Take advantage of Subgroup algorithms for performance and productivity.

* Use Subgroup Shuffle operations to avoid explicit memory operations.
