Module 4: DPCPP Sub Groups
##########################

This module examines SYCL **sub-groups** and why they are important. The code samples demonstrate how to implement a query for sub-group info, sub-group shuffles, and sub-group algorithms.

Learning Objectives 
********************

* Understand the advantages of using sub-groups in SYCL.

* Take advantage of sub-group algorithms for performance and productivity.

* Use Sub Group Shuffle operations to avoid explicit memory operations.
