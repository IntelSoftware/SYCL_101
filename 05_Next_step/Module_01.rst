Module 1: oneAPI Intro
######################

This module introduces you to oneAPI and oneAPI's implementation 
of SYCL (Data Parallel C++/DPC++). You will learn about basic 
SYCL hello world program and how to compile SYCL code for 
Intel hardware using Data Parallel C++ Compiler.

Learning Objectives: 
********************

* Explain how the oneAPI programming model can solve the challenges of programming in a heterogeneous world.

* Use oneAPI projects to enable your workflows.

* Understand the SYCL language and programming model.

* Familiarization on the use Jupyter notebooks for training throughout the course.
