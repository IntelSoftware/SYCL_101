Module 3: DPCPP Unified Shared Memory
#####################################

This module demonstrates how to implement different modes 
of **Unified Shared Memory (USM)** in SYCL code, as well 
as how to solve for data dependencies for in-order 
and out-of-order tasks.

Learning Objectives 
********************

* Use new SYCL2020 features such as USM to simplify programming.

* Understand implicit and explicit ways of moving memory using USM.

* Solve data dependency between kernel tasks optimally.
